A version of RTKLIB optimized for single and dual frequency low cost GPS receivers, especially u-blox receivers.  It is based on RTKLIB 2.4.3 and is kept reasonably closely synced to that branch.  Documentation for RTKLIB is available at rtklib.com.   This software is provided “AS IS” without any warranties of any kind so please be careful, especially if using it in any kind of real-time application.

The latest version of the user manual is at: https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB/blob/demo5/doc/manual_demo5.pdf

This branch is based on the b33 branch of RTKLIB 2.4.3.  See the demo5_b34_dev branch for a version based on the 2.4.3 b34 branch, this is still a work in progress.
